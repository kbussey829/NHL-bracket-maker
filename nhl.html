        <h3>Playoff information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Each round is a collection of at most 7 games, played between the two teams indicated above or in the dropdown menu. The first team to win 4 games advances to the next round.</li>
            <li>Home-ice advantage: 
            <ul>
                <li>Games 1, 2, 5 (if necessary), and 7 (if necessary) are played in the home arena of the team with the home-ice advantage. The remaining games are played at the opposing team's home arena.</li>
                <li>For the first two rounds, home-ice advantage goes to the team with the higher placement in the regular season standings.</li>
                <li>For the conference finals and Stanley Cup finals, home-ice advantage goes to the team with the better record in the regular season.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Contrary to regular-season games, there are no shootouts in the playoffs. Instead, play continues in the form of overtime periods until a winning goal is scored.</li>
            <li>All Wild Card teams are assigned to the division of their first-round matchup for the duration of the playoffs, regardless of which division they play in during the regular season.</li>
        </ul>
